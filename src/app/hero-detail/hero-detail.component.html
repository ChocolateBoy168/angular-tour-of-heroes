<!--
  1.Add Angular's *ngIf directive to the <div> and set it to selectedHero.
  2.Don't forget the asterisk (*) in front of ngIf. It's a critical part of the syntax.
  3.When selectedHero is undefined, the ngIf removes the hero detail from the DOM.
    There are no selectedHero bindings to worry about.
    When the user picks a hero, selectedHero has a value and ngIf puts the hero detail into the DOM.
-->
<div *ngIf="hero">
  <h2>{{hero.name | uppercase}} Details</h2>
  <div><span>id: </span>{{hero.id}}</div>
  <div>
    <label>name:
      <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">
    </label>
  </div>
  <button (click)="goBack()">go back</button>
  <button (click)="save()">save</button>
</div>
